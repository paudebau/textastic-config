## Textastic Customization Files

From [Textastic Customization repository](https://github.com/blach/Textastic-Customization)

### Templates

Template files are located in the *Templates* subdirectory. 

#### File Format 

Textastic templates are simple JSON files with the following format:

```json
{
	"uuid": "74C6D420-A016-4659-AF92-B5CCC1AE53BB",
	"category": "HTML",
	"templates": [
		{
			"name": "HTML5",
			"fileExtension": "html",
			"snippet": "<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>${1:untitled}<\/title>\n<\/head>\n\n<body>$0\n<\/body>\n<\/html>"
		}
	]
}
```

* `uuid`: uniquely identifies the template file
* `category`: the category under which the templates in this file appear in the the template selection view
* `templates`: contains an array of code templates
  * `name`: the name under which this template appears in the template selection view
  * `fileExtension`: the file extension that is automatically added to the file name when the user selects this template
  * `snippet`: The snippet that is inserted after the file is created. Be sure to escape new line and tab characters with \n and \t. 
  
        Always use tab characters for indentation - if necessary, Textastic will replace them with space characters depending on the current settings. 
        
        Have a look at the [TextMate manual entry on snippets](http://manual.macromates.com/en/snippets) for an overview of the snippet syntax. Textastic supports tab stops, placeholders, mirrors and transformations. 
    
        Currently, only the `$UUID` variable is supported. It automatically creates a new `uuid` and inserts it.
        
#### Creating new templates

If you want to create a new template, create a UTF-8 .json file in the *"#Textastic/Templates"* folder in Textastic and choose the template called "Template" in the "Textastic" category. 

This will automatically create a new template file with a new `uuid`. Use the tab key to go from tab stop to tab stop and enter the necessary information. Be sure to save the template in the *"#Textastic/Templates"* folder or it will not be loaded by Textastic.

*Note*: you can also manually create `uuid`s using the `uuidgen` terminal command on Mac OS X.

#### Modifying existing templates

If you want to modify existing templates, you can get the template files from this repository, edit them and put the modified files in the *"#Textastic/Templates"* folder. Textastic will pick up the changes immediately when you open the template selection view in the file creation dialog. 

It is important that you do not change the `uuid`, so that your custom files will be used instead of the built-in ones with the same `uuid`. This behavior is the same as for custom syntax definitions as explained [in the manual](http://www.textasticapp.com/v4/manual/lessons/How_can_I_add_my_own_syntax_definitions__themes_and_templates.html).

### Code Completion

All code completion files are located in the *CodeCompletion* subdirectory. 

If you want to modify code completion definitions, you can edit them and put them in the *"#Textastic/CodeCompletion"* folder. Textastic will pick up the changes *at application startup time*, so you have to manually quit the app. If you do not change the `uuid`, your custom files will be used instead of the built-in ones. This behavior is the same as for custom syntax definitions as explained [in the manual](http://www.textasticapp.com/v4/manual/lessons/How_can_I_add_my_own_syntax_definitions__themes_and_templates.html).
